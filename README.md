# Secure-File-Encryption-and-Decryption-Tool
This project focuses on encrypting and decrypting files to ensure data confidentiality. It uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm with the CBC mode for strong encryption. The tool supports password-based encryption and includes a mechanism to generate secure encryption keys using a key derivation function (PBKDF2).
